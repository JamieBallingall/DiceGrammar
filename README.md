# DiceGrammar

An attempt to formalize the grammar rules for "standard" dice notation. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation) for an parital and informal discription.

To "use", copy the contents of `dice.bnf` into an EBNF parser such as [https://bnfplayground.pauliankline.com/] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation)

This repo is very much a work in progress. Do not use for anything remotely important.
